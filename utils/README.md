If you're a person who often generates code repositories you need to make a professional README.  I made this Node.js application to take a lot of the heavy lifting out of generating README‚Äôs.  Running the application will cause the user to be asked a series of questions which are then used by the application to auto-populate a README. Not only is the time to make a README dramatically reduced but the formatting and layout are also in a high quality standardized manner. One of the really cool things is that it also generates badges for the use license that is selected. 

## How to use the README generator
1. Copy to your local drive the files from the Git Repository
2. Open your terminal and go to the folder where you have placed the Repositry files
3. In the terminal run "npm init" to build the node.js modules
4. In ther terminal run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to install the inquirer dependencies
5. then in the terminal enter "node index.js" to run the application
6. Answer the questions and when you are done a new README.md will be generated for you
